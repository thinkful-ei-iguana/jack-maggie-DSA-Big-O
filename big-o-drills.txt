1a) O(1)
1b) O(n)

2 O(1)
No matter the size of the input 'value',  the algorithm
will take the same amt of time to complete determining whether the number is
even or odd because there's no iteration needed

3) O(n^2)
This algorithm uses nested loops

4) O(n)
Performs a single set of actions looping through each element of an array

5) O(n)
Performs a single set of actions looping through each element of an array

6) O(n^2)
This algorithm uses nested loops

7) O(n)
Performs a single set of actions looping through each element of an array

8) O(log(n))
The array/input is sorted, and the search for the specified item consists of cutting
the searched dataset in half with each step

9) O(1)
Looking for one item in an array

10) O(n)
This algorithm finds the smallest number that the input can be divided by (assuming
that it's greater than 2)

1. O(n)
2. O(n)
3. 0(n)
4. 0(n)
5. 0(n)
6. O(2^n)
